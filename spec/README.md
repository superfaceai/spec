# Superface Specifications

This repository contains the full specification for the Comlink language—profiles, maps, and providers—and the `super.json` format.

## How to create a new version

* All changes should start out as drafts. If there is no `draft` folder, create one by copying the `latest` directory.
* When it is time to convert the `draft` to the latest version, start by renaming the `latest` directory to the version number of the specification.
* Give the files in the `draft` directory a version based on the current day using the format YYYY.MM.DD.
* Rename the `draft` directory to `latest`.

## Draft specifications

The `draft` directory provides a copy of the specifications based on the currently-proposed changes. It's best to use the latest version found in the `latest` directory as the draft may change before it becomes a full version.
